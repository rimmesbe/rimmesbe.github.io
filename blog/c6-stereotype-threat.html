    <h4>January 30, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Stereotype threat is when a person feels they are in a position which puts him or her at risk of affirming a negative stereotype about a group they identify with. These groups could include the persons; race, gender, nationality, religion, really anything that they identify themselves as. Professor Steele made a great point in his lecture at Columbia stating; a person creates social identities based on the situation he or she is in or is dealing with. A woman in a room full of men identifies herself as a woman and that might be the most profound of her social identities in that situation. Now if that same woman is in a room full of black women, being white herself, she will most likely identify as white in that situation more than as a woman.<br /><br />

      The ‘threat’ in stereotype threat comes from the fear of affirming a negative stereotype of one of these identities. Studies have shown that a person under the pressure of stereotype threat will underperform. For example if you give a group of men and women a math test and present it as a test to see if women are less capable at math, there is a strong probability that the women taking that test will underperform. If the same test is presented without any gender implications the female performances greatly improve. It is the pressure of giving credence to the negative stereotype (women are not as good at math) that causes the drop in performance.<br /><br />

      One personal example that I’m sure many Americans who have traveled abroad may have experienced is being identified and stereotyped as an ‘American’. There are definitely some negative stereotypes about being American as there are for most nationalities. Most of us don’t walk around day to day identifying ourselves as American, but once you are surrounded by non-Americans you most likely will.<br /><br />

      I found this particular stereotype threat to be socially crippling. I would find myself avoiding any political topics and generally trying not to be opinionated at all. If I was looking for a job in another country I think stereotype threat would be a big handicap, especially in an interview situation. <br /><br />

      I think just knowing about stereotype threat will be helpful in mentally dealing with it. I think a long term solution is making stereotype threat a common issue so professional environments can be created or changed to help diminish it. As individuals it’s our responsibility to not reinforce negative stereotypes, but also to realize that we alone do not represent an entire group of people. Every individual has strengths and weaknesses and it is important to realize that we are not responsible for the existence of these negative stereotypes. It is also important that we provide a welcoming environment with no prejudgments based off of these stereotypes. I think keeping the DBC environment supportive, positive and kind will be a good first step in combating stereotype threat.<br /><br />
