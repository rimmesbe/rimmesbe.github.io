    I am super excited about the DBC experience. As someone coming from the college classroom experience I find it so refreshing that someone is trying to create a different and more effective learning environment. I like the idea of not being soley concerned about GPA's and sitting in lectures for hours with no follow up hands on exploring. I have a friend in the program who has told me how much DBC improves your communication skills as well as the technical knowledge. When I first started researching the different bootcamps I noticed that DBC has by far the longest at home prep phase. This was originally a concern for me, but after hearing feedback from my friend and Shareef's explaination I have a much greater understanding and I actually feel really positive about it.<br /><br/>
    I am very excited to be an active member of this learning environment and my expectations have not changed. I am going to be completely present in the moment and try not to worry about what comes after DBC or what came before. I really enjoy all of Shareef's videos, they get me excited and motivated to make the most out of this experience.
