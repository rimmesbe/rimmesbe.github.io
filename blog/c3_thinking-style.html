    <h4>January 9, 2015</h4>
    <p>
    The Gregorc Thinking Style categorizes peoples style of thinking. The first category is 'Perceptual Quality'. The two perception qualities are 'Concrete' and 'Abstract'. The concrete quality focus' on the five senses and what is infront of them. Concrete perceivers prefer tangible proof or information to understand the world around them. The abstract quality focus' more on what you cannot see, ie using ones imagination or intuition to fill in the gaps of what is infront of you. Abstract perceivers are more about the subtleties and implications than their concrete counter-parts.<br /><br />

    The next category in the Gregorc Thinking Style is the 'Ordering Ability'. Some people are 'Sequential' orderers, while others are 'Random' orderers. Sequential ordering is based on a linear, step-by-step, logical thought. Sequential ordering relies more on structure and plans rather than impulse. Random ordering organizes information into chunks with no real order(maybe arrays vs hashes would be a good analogy here). Random organizers will often skip steps or start in the middle of a procedure, as they are less dependent on linear structure.<br /><br />

    My Gregorc results pinned me as a multimodal thinker, meaning I use a combination of different thinking styles. My results were split very closely between 'Concrete Sequential' and 'Abstract Sequential'. My highest category was Abstract Sequential which is fitting in my opinion. I often find myself approaching situations with a concrete sequential mindset of thinking I will follow the instructions to a tee, relying on facts, and hope things turn out predictable. However all that usually goes out the window once I start a project because I actually like to analyze situations from different angles and play around with many optional outcomes. I also learn best from experts and references. <br /><br />
    I think my thinking style will be very beneficial in the psuedocoding phase, because I will be able to play around with many different solutions and strategies. Abstract sequential thinkers work well in stimulating environments, and I think DBC will be a stimulating environment. I look forward to working with all different thinking style and experiencing the advantages of each.<br /><br />

    I have really enjoyed my phase 0 experience so far. I've had a lot of new experiences and have learned a lot of new things like; html, css, git & github, working with a pair, and working in the command line. My biggest struggles so far have been in the set-up phase which I attribute to using a pc laptop on powershell. I've always been a pc user. Part of me wants to break down and get a mac, and the other part of me wants to stick it out and learn both. We'll see how the rest of phase 0 goes before I make my final decision. As  far as the 'Learning Competencies' I think I'm on track and learning the new material effectively. <br /><br />

    The two mindsets we've looked at are the growth mindset and the fixed mindset. A fixed mindset believes that what intelligence you have now is the intelligence you will have forever. Fixed mindsets look for challenges they know they are good at because they require positive results to prove their value. They avoid failure at all cost and view effort as a waste of energy. Often will not take constructive feedback well. <br />
    The 'Growth mindset' believes intelligence can be developed and is not static. Growth mindsets will often take on challenges even if there is a high chance of failure. They see the challenge as a learning opportunity and a chance to learn from criticism. They see effort as the path to improvement. <br /><br />

    I will have to admit that in my earlier life I definitely had a fixed mindset. By earlier life I mean highschool and early college. The older I get the more open I am to learning new things and admitting my own shortcomings. I have definitely moved over to a growth mindset and I think it is because life has humbled me a bit, which I see as a positive. Our current education system in this country is heavily based on testing and competition. I think this focus breeds fixed mindsets and should be something we move away from. I've always said that college taught me what I don't know more than what I do know, which has helped me develope a growth mindset. I plan on approaching the DBC experience as humbly and open as possible.
