    <h4>January 25, 2015</h4>
    <p>
    Pairing:<br />
    Pair Programming has been a new experience for me. The online classes and even the college classes I’ve taken have not taken advantage of this powerful learning tool.<br /><br />
    Thus far I have had many different experiences with peer programming. I think this is due to the fact that there are many types of people with many types of personalities. Sometimes communication is open and clear and other times it can be closed and awkward. Sometimes a session can feel productive and efficient, while other times it can feel handicapped and frustrating.<br /><br />
    I think the biggest issue I’ve encountered in pair programming is defining roles and expectations of those roles. Sometimes the roles are too loosely defined and other times they are overly constricting. For example if a ‘driver’ is given complete free-reign the driver may go off in his/her own direction without taking input from the navigator. On the other hand you don’t want to completely handicap the driver, basically turning him into a human typing machine while the navigator does all the planning and solving.<br /><br />
    I believe the perfect balance lies somewhere in-between. During the brainstorming/solving phase I think open communication works best. During the actual implementation is when the roles come into play. The major difficulty with this is that a majority of the pairing time is spent researching and brainstorming. 
    Ultimately I have really enjoyed pairing and I have learned a lot of new techniques and skills from my peers at DBC. I think pair programming like anything else can be learned and improved over time. I look forward to improving my own communication skills, being a quieter and introverted thinker. I tend to think quietly rather than out loud, which can be particularly unhelpful in the navigator roll.<br /><br />
    Feedback:<br />
    I’ve mostly received positive feedback thus far from my peers, so that makes me feel good. Some of the feedback from my GPS coaches has been a little disappointing. I’ve gotten some “with difficulty” reviews about reading code. I don’t think taking five minutes to understand a Ruby method I’ve never seen before is a sub-par performance. GPS sessions in general have felt rushed and mostly unhelpful. Most of the feedback I get is “research that more”.<br /><br />
    The main thing I’m going to try differently in the future is working on the challenge on my own for a little while before pairing. This way I’ll have more understanding of the problem and have a bit more of an idea of how we can solve it. Then when we pair we can compare strategies and come up with the best solution. With the rate these challenges are increasing in difficulty, we’re looking at some 4-5 hour pairing sessions next week.<br /><br />
    Writing feedback was harder than I thought. The hardest part is being actionable. Being kind and specific about positive accomplishments is easy, but being kind while telling someone they need to improve on something is hard. I also feel like I’m not qualified to give advice a lot of the time.
