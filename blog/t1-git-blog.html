  <h2>Git, Github, and Version Control</h2>

      Version Control allows you to save states in your work. If you add new code to your work that you end up not liking, you can roll-back your code to a previous state. For the gamers out there, it is much like keeping multiple save states when playing a videogame incase you find yourself at a dead end or in an unbeatable situation.

        So Git is a program that is great for implimenting Version Control. When you make changes to a file you then "commit" those changes to later be "pushed" into your master copy of the file. Everytime you commit your Git saves the changes you have made into another version of the file, so you can access it in the future. Even if you add tons of new stuff you can always roll-back to the exact state the file was earlier commited in. Sticking with the videogame simile, Git works as if you hit "make new save file" every time you save your game, aka commit changes.

        The great thing about Github is that you can share your coding projects with teammates, friends, and even the public. By pushing your code and your code commits onto Github, you keep others who might be working on the same project up to date with your changes and vice versa. Github also allows you to make "pull requests" which is a form of double checking your work with another persons eyes, before commiting the changes to the "master" branch file. Github is the perfect vessel for distributing and collecting code files to remote machines. Video game tie-in: Lets say you and your friend want to play through an rpg together on the same file from your seperate systems. Imagine a cloud type storage where when you finished playing, your save state (or multiple save states, remember) would be uploaded to the cloud where your friend could access it. He(or she) would then load that save file onto his system to continue the game where you left off. This is how Github works for coding projects.
