    <h4>January 16, 2015</h4>
    <p>
    A major issue facing the competitive tech industry today is the use of performance enhancing drugs. No, I'm 
    not talking about steroids, I'm talking about Adderall and other amphetamines. These prescription drugs were
    created for the treatment of ADHD(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), but many people use them for a
    mental boost and stimulant. We've all heard of Hack-a-thons and people pulling 36 hour coding sessions to launch their brand new app, but what is the price?<br /><br />

    In case you haven't figured it out yet, there is no perfect drug. Every drug ever created has its price, and I'm not speaking monetarily. Adderall is a prescription drug, prescribed by a doctor to treat Attention deficit disorders. When used in appropriate doses for treating appropriate disorders these drugs are usually not harmful. However when people start self-diagnosing and self-medicated, physical and psychological side-effects may arise. In high doses amphetamines can become addictive, as tolerance increases rapidly. It is also important to remember it is not just the side-effects of the drug itself, but what it allows you to put your body through, ie: staying up for 36 hours straight and having no appetite.<br /><br />

    Why have these drugs become so popular in the tech world? Well for starters it's a competitive market place, especially in the startup world. Salaries for coders is very high and people expect to get a lot of bang for their buck. Hack-a-thons and 24 hour+ coding sessions are idolized in the industry. Having to think all day is very mentally exhausting and these drugs allow you to push your brain farther than it naturally wants to go. <br /><br />
    
    So you can probably see how the pressure is being applied to use these drugs. If your co-worker is using them to stay up all night and bang out a weeksâ€™ worth of work in two days, and you're not... It shouldn't be surprising to realize many owners and investors are going to turn a blind eye to drug abuse for increased productivity. So the question arises, are the drugs the problem or is it the expectations of productivity? Staying up all night may not sound so bad when you are in your 20's. How about when you are in your 40's or 50's and you have a family? Should you lose your job to a twenty year old who is willing to use drugs to thrash his body to be unrealistically productive?<br /><br />

    This is obviously a huge subject, and this is just a very brief view point on the matter. I recommend doing your own research if this issue interests you.
